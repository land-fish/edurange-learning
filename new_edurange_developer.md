# New EDURange Developer Intro

This guide is a resource to new EDURange developers. If you already have
a decent amount of experience with rails and ruby, then this introduction
might not be that useful to you. If you're new to rails, and perhaps new
to large software projects, then I hope this guide will be helpful to you.
